# Blackjack
![video placeholder]()
Blackjack is my own implementation of card game Blackjack made with C++ and SDL2. This project was built within 14 days as my test task.
***

## Project Overview
This task required to implement basic rules of Blackjack and some additional features like changing cards skin at runtime.  During this project I implemented a lot of experimental staff with what I'm not sure, and basically whole engine. Some memory leaks might be present. Approximate time spent: 100 hours (14 days)
due to the overly ambitious size of the project, I didn't have enough time to complete some features related to the UI, but overall the game works well.
